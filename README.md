# CleanDownload

Are you tired of your download folder being in mess? Got bunch of files from questionable sources you need to sort?
Don't worry, there is a solution to your problem.<br>
<b>The clean python script</b><br>
It sorts your movies and shows into a seperate folder, each show has a seperate file for their season

## Functionality

- Sorts movies and series into a seperate folder
- Each series has a seperate file for each season

## Known Bugs

- Doesn't sort the season/episodes if it starts on telling which season and episode it is
  <br>ex: S01E04.How I.Met.Your.Mother.avi 
- Currently only works for windows (might change in the future)
- The search api functionality which was used is not perfect and might not find the show/movie or sort them in the wrong category
